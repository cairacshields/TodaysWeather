# TodaysWeather

Get the current weather for your city instantly!

This app uses AsyncTasks, Web services, and the JSON class to parse and show a specific set of current data. 

I used the following website API to gather the acurate weather information: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather

You will need to create your own account and generate a unique API Key to use in the URL header.
